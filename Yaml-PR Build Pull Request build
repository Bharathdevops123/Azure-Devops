How to Create a PR Build.

1) We need to create a separate pipeline for the build pipeline with build.yml and name the pipeline as "PR Pipeline". I has to contain only build part.

2) Now we have to set Pull request policies to trigger a pipeline when a PR is raised
Go to Project settings -->Repository --> Select the Repo and click on Policies --> Click on Dev branch --Go to Build Validation

Fill out the Build form
Select the PR Pipeline under Build name 
Trigger : Automatic
Policy Requirement: Require (Build must succeed in order to complete the pull request)
Build Expiration : Immediate
Policy Name: <Give your own Policy name example : PR Policy"

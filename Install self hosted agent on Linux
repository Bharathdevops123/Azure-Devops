Create a folder on the server in home directory
cd home
mkdir Agent1
cd Agent1
download the agent 
wget https://vstsagentpackage.azureedge.net/agent/2.181.2/vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.181.2.tar.gz

tar zxvf ~/Downloads/vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.181.2.tar.gz

 ./config.sh
Give the ADO url till orgaization and give other details as asked
 ./run.sh

If we do like this if Agent is not running after we close the putty session then we need to install svc.sh
cd Agent1
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo svc.sh start

by this the agent will keep on running in the background even if we close the putty session

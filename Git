-----------------------------------------
In Git we have working directory, Staging Area, Local git repository and Remote Git repository.

git init - Initializes a Repository
git config --global user.name "Bharath"  -- Configures username
git config --global user.email "medojuBharathkumar07@gmail.com"  -- Configures email
git config list -- lists all the configurations
git remote set-url orign git@<url -- makes connection to remote git.
git add . - adds files to staging directory
git add fileA.txt - Adds fileA.txt to staging area
git reset fileA.txt - undo the file from staging area
git status - Give current status of working directory
git checkout <feature> : switches to feature branch
git commit -m "<message> - moves the code to Local Git repository

Revert a pushed commit in Git: This should be done for shared repo
-----------------------------------------------------------------
git revert <commit ID> ---> This command will revert the commit. After the files are reverted you can check in a new commit 
          with the message revert commit". and then you can push the commit git push origin <branch name>. Same like TFVC                           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2DuJNWbqLw
git revert Head~1 : This reverts last commit
git revert Head~4 : This reverts last 4 commits

To Delete a pushed commit in Git: This can be done for personal repo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
git reset --hard <commitID> or git reset --hard Head~1 --> This will delete the commit

git commit -- amend --> if you forgot to add a change in the last commit we can add that change to staging area and then                     give git commit amend this wil include the change to the last commit

git log - gives commit history .
git log -all : gives all commit history
git log -p : gives commit history and code changes
git log --oneline : gives commit ids and messages
git log --since=29-03-2019 --untill=22-04-2020

git push origin <branch> : To Push the code to remote branch or origin

git branch dev : creates a dev branch
git push origin --delete dev : Deletes remote dev branch
git branch -d dev: Delete dev branch
git branch -D dev: Delete dev branch -D means force delete

Merge
-----
git checkout master - switches to master branch
git merge feature - merges feature branch to master.
if we want to merge from feature to master first we need to go to master and then run merge command

Stash
-----
git stash push --include-untracked -m <stashname>: if you are working on some files and you dont want to delete them for now. you can save them in stash
git stash list
git stash apply "stash@{n}" -->  n =0,1,2... this will get our changes from the statsh n but will KEEP the stash
git stash pop "stash@{n}" -->  n =0,1,2... this will get our changes from the statsh n but will DELETE the stash
git stash drop "stash@{n}" --> Deletes the stash n

git clean --> Removes the files that are nt under version control

Git File status
U- Untracked files - new files are there in working directory but they are not added to Git
M - File is modified

-----------------------------------------
In Git we have working directory, Staging Area, Local git repository and Remote Git repository.

git init - Initializes a Repository
git config --global user.name "Bharath"  -- Configures username
git config --global user.email "medojuBharathkumar07@gmail.com"  -- Configures email
git config list -- lists all the configurations
git remote set-url orign git@<url -- makes connection to remote git.
git add . - adds files to staging directory
git add fileA.txt - Adds fileA.txt to staging area
git reset fileA.txt - undo the file from staging area
git status - Give current status of working directory
git checkout <feature> : switches to feature branch
git commit -m "<message> - moves the code to Local Git repository

Revert a pushed commit in Git: This should be done for shared repo
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Create a new branch.
run below command. you can see the files in the staged area. give the commit message and commit the changes.
Push the branch to the Repo and create a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch.

git revert <commit ID> -m 1 ---> This command will revert the commit. After the files are reverted you can check in a new commit 
          with the message revert commit". and then you can push the commit git push origin <branch name>. Same like TFVC                           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2DuJNWbqLw

git revert Head~1 : This reverts last commit
git revert Head~4 : This reverts last 4 commits

Revert only one file from a changeset:
--------------------------------------
git revert <commit id> -m 1      : Here 1 means the main line parent 
Create a new branch
Now in Visual studio remove the files from the staged area section which you dont want to revert.
Undo unwanted files from changes section.
in the Staged area have only files that you want to revert changes. Give Commit message. --> commit the code--> push the branch
Create a pull request from this branh to the main branch.


To Delete a pushed commit in Git: This can be done for personal repo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
git reset --hard <commitID> or git reset --hard Head~1 --> This will delete the commit

git commit -- amend --> if you forgot to add a change in the last commit we can add that change to staging area and then                     give git commit amend this wil include the change to the last commit

git log - gives commit history .
git log -all : gives all commit history
git log -p : gives commit history and code changes
git log --oneline : gives commit ids and messages
git log --since=29-03-2019 --untill=22-04-2020

git push origin <branch> : To Push the code to remote branch or origin

git branch dev : creates a dev branch
git push origin --delete dev : Deletes remote dev branch
git branch -d dev: Delete dev branch
git branch -D dev: Delete dev branch -D means force delete

Merge branches
---------------
git checkout master - switches to master branch
git merge feature - merges feature branch to master.
if we want to merge from feature to master first we need to go to master and then run merge command

Merge speicific commits from one branch to other branch
-------------------------------------------------------
If you have committed changes to the master branch. Now you want to move that same commit to release-branch. 
Check the commit id(Eg:xyzabc123) for the commit.
Now try following the commands
git checkout release-branch
git cherry-pick xyzabc123 --  merge commit to release-branch
git cherry-pick commit1 commit2 commit3 commit4 commit5 -- to merge multiple commits
git push origin release-branch


Stash
-----
git stash push --include-untracked -m <stashname>: if you are working on some files and you dont want to delete them for now. you can save them in stash
git stash list
git stash apply "stash@{n}" -->  n =0,1,2... this will get our changes from the statsh n but will KEEP the stash
git stash pop "stash@{n}" -->  n =0,1,2... this will get our changes from the statsh n but will DELETE the stash
git stash drop "stash@{n}" --> Deletes the stash n

git clean --> Removes the files that are not under version control

git pull : Gets all the commits and code changes to local git repo and Working directory
git fetch: Gets the commits and code changes to Local git Repo but NOT to the Working directory

Git File status
U- Untracked files - new files are there in working directory but they are not added to Git
M - File is modified

Tools to work with Git: Visual studio Code, Command Prompt, Git bash

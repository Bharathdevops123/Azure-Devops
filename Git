git log - gives commit history
git log -all - gives all commit history

-----
git stash push --include-untracked -m <stashname>: if you are working on some files and you dont want to delete them for now. you can save them in stash
git stash list
git stash apply "stash@{n}" -->  n =0,1,2... this will get our changes from the statsh n but will KEEP the stash
git stash pop "stash@{n}" -->  n =0,1,2... this will get our changes from the statsh n but will DELETE the stash
git stash drop "stash@{n}" --> Deletes the stash n

git clean --> Removes the files that are nt under version control

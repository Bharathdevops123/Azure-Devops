In the ADO Build pipeline.
Add SonarQube tasks from the Market place to the Organization.
Add below Tasks to the build
1) Prepare Analysis on SonarQube for .net application
 - Use Standalone scanner mostly
 - You can also use Integrate with MS build (if this is used you have to Prepare analysis before the MS build and Run Code 
   analysis after the MS build and VStests task)
2) Use Java Installer (Select Preinstalled)
3) Run Code Analysis 
4) Publist Quality Gate Results (This will upload results to the pipeline)

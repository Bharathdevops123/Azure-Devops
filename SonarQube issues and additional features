SonarQube issues and additional features
1) Using SonarQube community edition we can scan only main branch for free
Solution: Run sonarqube community edition only on Main branch

2)Move to Developer edition error
If we are running sonar scan on a Dev branch using community edition and getting any error to move to Developer edition then
Validation of project failed:
  o To use the property "sonar.branch.name" and analyze branches, Developer Edition or above is required.
See https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analyzing-source-code/branches/branch-analysis/ for more information.

Solution : Add a powershell task after dotnet build and before Run Analysis
$params = "$env:SONARQUBE_SCANNER_PARAMS" -replace '"sonar.branch.name":"[\w,/,-]*"\,?'
Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=SONARQUBE_SCANNER_PARAMS]$params"

This will resolve run the scan but it will run only on Main branch even if we do a build on developer branch
